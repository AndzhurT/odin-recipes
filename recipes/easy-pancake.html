    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> This easy pancake recipe doesn't require much thought 
        early in the morning and the pancakes taste great!</p>

    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> (1 cup all-purpose flour) - This quick pancake recipe starts with a cup of all-purpose flour. </li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> (2 tablespoons white sugar) - You'll need two tablespoons of white sugar. </li>
        <li><b>Baking Powder:</b> (2 teaspoons baking powder) - Baking powder acts as a leavening agent, ensuring perfectly fluffy pancakes. </li>
        <li><b>Salt:</b> (1 teaspoon salt, or to taste) - Salt enhances the overall flavor of the pancakes, but it won't make the pancakes taste salty.</li>
        <li><b>Milk</b> and <b>Oil:</b> (1 cup milk and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil) - Milk and oil add moisture and flavor to the pancake batter. </li>
        <li><b>Egg:</b> (1 egg, beaten) - A beaten egg lends more moisture and helps bind the batter together. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining batter</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
